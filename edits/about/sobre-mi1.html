											My beginnings are so typical of so many artists in my generation, where art schools were not abundant and, those that were, did not respond to the concerns of the moment; rather, they were asleep in a neoclassical dream. There also coincides a very special time: my adolescence corresponds to the concerns of 68, which means that the spirit of vindication and search, of which religious authorities did not approve. Apart from socio-political events, all European societies sought new references in practically all disciplines.
										</p>
										<p>
											It was the time of the popularization of psychoanalysis, the great emergence of art books and artists, anarchism, and an enormous desire to seek, as well as new forms of relationships in families. It was the age of hippies, the questioning of religion. I think it was the time when it was normal to be born artistic, and self-taught. My first works reflect an interest in expressionism, surrealism, the fascination with psychoanalysis and, of course, given the youth, an explosive sexual interest. 
										</p>
										<p>
											In addition, my way of dedicating myself to art compared with my studies was like the expression of certain concerns. As a way of finding a certain identity, and not for a moment, it occurred to me that this could become a way of life. And not because I did not see it in others, but because the road was so arduous and so unknown. However, it is true - and I am not the only case - that once this path has begun, it makes you immune to any other alternative.

										My first works were of painting. We could consider it as a laboratory, where I was getting enough security in my work, which prepared my introduction to sculpture. This time was very important because of my interest in making characters very clear in form, and this interest facilitated my transition to sculpture. Initially, the theme was influenced by expressionism and creating images that were easy to digest within a certain surrealist vision. 
									</p>
									<p>
										This period lasted relatively short. Then, the economic needs and the desire for independence led me to accept jobs in the cadaster. This puts me in touch with the rural world in a more intense way than I knew. It was the encounter with nature that seemed new to me.  Moreover, I became more familiar with the Romanesque and Baroque style, where I appreciated in many years later when I was in Mexico.

										This new influence led me to a radical change of work. I began to create characters as if they had come from the earth, created collective scenes that I owed much to popular culture. It coincided that in my city, this type of art had very outstanding figures. For me, this makes me think of Arturo Baltar. Over the years, this artist - in the sense of Naïf - produced altarpieces and small installations with an  unparalleled poetic character.
									
									</p>
									<p>
										My artistic interest was evolving toward visions much more realistic and devoid of any element that I considered literary. I focused in the learning of the anatomy, to the point of getting to create works that seemed to me like torsion machines, where the muscles had to manifest the tension, the torsion, or any other of the possibilities of this muscle movement, where it was very evident where the first movement had started and its sequences thereafter. All these without diminishing the interest in facial expressions as a motor of understanding the whole work.

										It seems to me that all my evolution is like a nucleus to which layers are superimposed, where the art gets bigger or more complex, but in which there are no discarded parts, and that the initial focus continues to be manifested.  
									</p>
									<p>
										The next step was a mixture of contradictions: to bring the expression of strength and softness together in one character, the muscled and the flabby, the masculine and feminine character, the young and the old. This kind of contradictory universal, and synthetic character constituted the essence of my work almost up to the present. Obviously, some aspects took longer to develop than others. The feminine or androgynous appearance was anterior to the clearly masculine one. The old was before the young. Some of these works are installed in public spaces, where they fit well in our environment because their geological aspect evokes our rounded mountains, full of protruding rocks and transmit a feeling between soft and powerful.

										There were times that I was very tempted to created works with architectural aspects. Also, beyond the anecdotal aspects, I consider the volumes, lines, and the perfect finish. 
										The scale was always monumental. The small work was always a beginning that aspired to that bigger dimension. I alternated the interest in polychromy - with the singularizing characteristic that it has - with the uniform color, which underlines the form. In other words, polychromatic works in resins, with works in bronze.
